== Consumer guide

This document provides the guidelines for using the SCM API.

This document is structured as follows:

* The first section provides some background into the use cases driving the development of the SCM API.

* The second section is an overview of all the functionality provided by the SCM API.

* The subsequent sections consider each of the API extension points in turn and the recommended usage patterns

=== Background

The initial core use case for Jenkins is that of monitoring a project in source control and when the project changes, checking out the modified source, building the source and reporting the results of that build to the people who made the changes.

As Jenkins usage has grown, the use cases have also grown.

The initial design of Jenkins was focused on creating Jenkins jobs for each project in source control.

For projects that have a single mainline of development, there would typically be a 1:1 relationship between projects in source control and jobs in Jenkins.

For projects that have multiple mainlines of development, for example where there may be multiple sustaining branches for older releases, there would be multiple Jenkins jobs for each project: one for each branch.

Initially, creating one job for each development branch seems reasonable:

* The older branches may require older versions of the build toolchain.
* The job changelog for each branch reflects the changes in that branch.
* The build break / fix status for each branch is correct
* The creation of the branch job is just a copy operation within Jenkins - or a rename and copy if you want to move the build history.

There are some issues however:

* When a sustaining branch is removed, we need to remember to delete the corresponding sustaining job.
* If we need to make a configuration change that affects multiple branches, we have to configure the Jenkins jobs in the UI in multiple places.
* These are potentially _heavyweight_ copy operations: the copy has to be performed within Jenkins itself - often times the Jenkins administrator will have restricted permissions for job creation and thus the creation of the branch job may require internal support tickets, etc.
* Developers do not get the CI feedback support when working on short-lived feature branches, thus the benefits of CI are only seen when merging the feature branches back to a mainline which increases the risk of a broken mainline build.
* Inter project job chain dependencies can become incredibly difficult to manage.
+
If project A depends on project B then we may have complex triggers between each projects different branch sustaining lines.
* We you have even more projects, most jobs are doing mostly the same thing and reuse of these patterns and/or implementation of organizational best practices becomes hard.
This is especially a concern when those organizational best practices change and you have thousands of jobs that need to be updated.

One of the first attempts to solve this problem was introduced by the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin[Git plugin]:

* Rather than having a job track a single branch, a job could be configured that tracked multiple branches.

The side-effect of this, is that:

* The job changelog is now meaningless.
+
In some cases there is no relationship between the revision of the previous build and the revision of the current build, so asking for a list of changes between them is semi-random.
* The build break / fix status is now meaningless.
+
The previous build may be from a different feature branch and may be broken.
Your build is on your feature branch and is not broken.
+
Jenkins then notifies you and the developer of the other feature branch that the build is now "Fixed".
* The trend lines for test results are now meaningless.
* The trend lines for code coverage are now meaningless.
* The trend lines for static analysis are now meaningless.
* Forget about triggering downstream jobs of other projects as a result of a build as there is no guarantee that the upstream job build even warrants the downstream job to be triggered.

In order to allow for some rollback of some of these side-effects, typically one would:

* Create a job that just builds the master branch.
* Create one job each for each of the sustaining branches that need to be tracked.
* Create one job that builds everything else (including for example pull requests).

This leaves only one job with meaningless change logs / build status history / trend charts / etc, but we still have the issue of needing to maintain all the sustaining branches.

The https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Branch+API+Plugin[Branch API plugin] was developed as a second alternative solution to this problem space.
The idea behind the Branch API plugin is to have a special job type which will follow all the branches in a repository and create sub-jobs for each branch. These branch specific jobs can then be managed automatically by the multi-branch project such that they can be removed automatically after the corresponding branch has been removed.

Each branch specific sub-job has:

* a valid changelog
* a valid build break / fix status
* valid trendlines

Other benefits include:

* Developers can create feature branches and get the CI benefits for that feature branch automatically without needing to worry about requesting creation of corresponding feature branch jobs.
* The Jenkins administrator does not need to worry about having to clean up old feature branch jobs that are no longer required.

There still remain other issues that the Branch API plugin cannot solve on its own:

* Each branch specific job needs to be configured.
+
If different branches need different job configuration -- which may be highly likely if a feature branch is refactoring the build process -- we need to be able to get the automatically configured jobs to have the correct configuration.

* For inter-project dependencies, it can be unclear how to establish branch relationships.
+
Should branch `feature-23` of project A be using the artifacts from branch `master` of project B or from branch `sustaining-1.x`.

Efforts to solve these issues are a responsibility of the plugins that implement multi-branch project types.

* The https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Literate+Plugin[Literate plugin] stores the job configuration in a file (`README.md`) in source control directly in the branch.
+
Thus if the one branch uses a different build process then the configuration for that branch can live within that branch.
+
The type of build configuration supported by the literate plugin is, as a result of the configuration file format, restricted to shell steps and publishers.
+
The literate plugin also follows the principle of keeping all job configuration in the branch to which it relates.
This means if you want to change one aspect of the build process in multiple branches at the same time, you need to explicitly replicate the changes to all the branches.
Whether this is an advantage or disadvantage depends on your point of view.
* The https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Multibranch+Plugin[Pipeline Multibranch plugin] also stores the job configuration in a file (`Jenkinsfile`) in source control directly in the branch.
+
That file can reference lightweight "plugins" in the form of https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Shared+Groovy+Libraries+Plugin[shared groovy libraries].
This allows for a Jenkins administrator to split some reusable best practices into a shared library.
Changing the best practice in the global shared library can then affect all the branches simultaneously -- or if the shared library version was pinned you would need to push the library version update to the required branches.

The SCM API within Jenkins, which is based on `hudson.scm.SCM` did not provide the required functionality.

In order to allow the missing functionality to be more of more general utility, the decision was taken to put the SCM functionality into a separate API plugin, namely this SCM API plugin.

The initial SCM API extension points were driven by a lot of the use cases of the Branch API plugin, but the design has been tempered to try and allow for other unanticipated use cases.

The primary requirements of the Branch API are:

* provide a means to enumerate all the "branches" of a "repository"

* provide a means to identify interesting "branches", by checking whether the branch has specific files or perhaps even checking the contents of specific files within the branch.

* provide a means to enumerate all the "repositories" of a "source control server"

=== Overview

The SCM API exposes four main extension points for consumers:

* The `jenkins.scm.api.SCMSource` extension point is designed to solve the use case of iterating all the "branches" / "tags" / "change requests" in a "project / repository".

* The `jenkins.scm.api.SCMNavigator` extension point is designed to solve the use case of iterating all the "projects / repositories" in a "source control system / server / team / organization".

* The `jenkins.scm.api.SCMFileSystem` extension point is designed to solve the use cases of browsing the content of a specific "branches" / "tags" / "change requests" and optionally retrieving specific files.

Consumers will likely be interested in implementing the following extension points:

* The `jenkins.scm.api.SCMEventListener` extension point is designed to solve the use case of receiving notification of events from the source control systems.

Consumers will be required to implement the following contract interfaces depending on their use of the extension points of the SCM API:

* Any `hudson.model.Item` that owns some `jenkins.scm.api.SCMSource` instances must implement `jenkins.scm.api.SCMSourceOwner`.
+
.SCMSourceOwner implementation discovery
[NOTE]
====
In the general case, the `hudson.model.Item` above will be `TopLevelItem` instances within the standard Jenkins item hierarchy.

If your object is not discoverable through `Jenkins.getInstance().getAllItems(SCMSourceOwner.class)` then you will need to provide an implementation of the  `SCMSourceOwners.Enumerator` extension point that can find your object.
====

* Any `hudson.model.Item` that owns some `jenkins.scm.api.SCMNavigator` instances must implement `jenkins.scm.api.SCMNavigatorOwner`.
+
.SCMNavigatorOwner implementation discovery
[NOTE]
====
In the general case, the `hudson.model.Item` above will be `TopLevelItem` instances within the standard Jenkins item hierarchy.

If your object is not discoverable through `Jenkins.getInstance().getAllItems(SCMNavigator.class)` then you will need to provide an implementation of the  `SCMNavigatorOwners.Enumerator` extension point that can find your object.
====

=== Using SCMSource instances

Each `SCMSource` assumes that it is owned by a `SCMSourceOwner` object.
The owner is responsible for:

* providing a context from which the `SCMSource` can resolve any required `Credentials` via the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin[Credentials plugin]

* providing any `SCMSourceCriteria` that would be required by the `SCMSource` in order to determine if a candidate `SCMHead` is actually a `SCMHead` that the owner is interested in.

While it is possible to use a detached `SCMSource` without an owner, when operated in such a fashion, it is exceedingly likely that any required credentials will be unresolved and thus the usage may fail.

When loading `SCMHead` or `SCMRevision` instances from persistence on disk, a consumer is recommended to pass the objects through `SCMHeadMigration.readResolveSCMHead(SCMSource,SCMHead)` or `SCMHeadMigration.readResolveSCMRevision(SCMSource,SCMRevision)`.

==== `SCMSourceOwner` contract

If you implement `jenkins.scm.api.SCMSourceOwner` your implementation *must*:

* Be discoverable through `jenkins.scm.api.SCMSourceOwners`.
+
This is the normal expected situation and will be the case if your implementation is part of the standard `Jenkins.getInstance().getAllItems()` tree.
+
[NOTE]
====
The contract for `hudson.model.Item` does not mandate that instances be discoverable through `Jenkins.getInstance().getAllItems()`.

For example, it is conceivable that a plugin might decide to store `hudson.model.User` specific `hudson.model.Item` through a custom `hudson.model.ItemGroup` attached to the owning user.

If your plugin has decided to wander off the well established idiom, you will have to pay the cost of providing an implementation of `SCMSourceOwners.Enumerator` that can discover your `jenkins.scm.api.SCMSourceOwner` instances in order to ensure that events are delivered correctly.
====

* Ensure that `SCMSource.setOwner(_owner_)` has been called before any `SCMSource` instance is returned from either `SCMSourceOwner.getSCMSources()` or `SCMSourceOwner.getSCMSource_id)`.
+
Normally this is achieved by setting the owner on creation, load and reconfiguration. Lazy owner setting immediately before first access of any specific SCMSource is also a valid solution.

* Trigger a reindex of at least the specified source on receipt of a `SCMSourceOwner.onSCMSourceUpdated(_source_)` notification.

* Call `SCMSource.afterSave()` on all the  `SCMSourceOwner.getSCMSources()` instances after every save of the `SCMSourceOwner`.

Your implementation of `jenkins.scm.api.SCMSourceOwner` *should*:

* Assume that `SCMSource.fetch(_observer_, _listener_)` may ignore your `SCMSourceOwner.getSCMSourceCriteria` -- not all source control systems will have the ability to perform either shallow probes (via `jenkins.scm.SCMProbe`) let alone deep probes (via `SCMProbe.getRoot()` or `jenkins.scm.SCMFileSystem.of(...)`)

* Persist the results of any discovery of any interesting `SCMHead` instances resulting from calls to `SCMSource.fetch(...)` in some form or other.
+
For example the Branch API plugin creates sub-jobs for each `SCMHead` that it is interested in.
The `SCMHead` instances are persisted with their corresponding sub-jobs and the `SCMRevision` instances are persisted with the builds that were triggered for each discovered `SCMRevision`.

* Have a `jenkins.scm.api.SCMEventListener` implementation to respond to events.
+
The listener will need to update the required `SCMSourceOwner` instances on the basis of the event and should minimize full indexing, e.g. by using the `SCMSource.fetch(..., _event_, _listener_)` variants.

* Persist the results of `SCMSource.fetchActions(_listener_)` as part of each index and on receipt of any `SCMSourceEvent` events of type `CREATED` or `UPDATED`.
+
[TIP]
====
It may not always be either possible or preferred to attach the actions directly to the owner.

For example, `hudson.model.AbstractProject` subclasses do not allow modification of the project's actions (because `AbstractProject.getActions()` returns a read-only list and `Actionable.addAction(_action_)` tries to add the action to the list returned by `getActions()`).

An alternative is to persist the actions through some other mechanism (in the case of the `AbstractProject` subclass, we could store them in a `JobProperty`) and then populate at runtime them using a `TransientItemActionFactory`
====

The primary purpose of the `SCMSource` API is to allow the enumeration of `SCMHead` instances (and their current corresponding `SCMRevision`) from the source, so presumably you have implemented `SCMSourceOwner` because you want to do something with the `SCMHead` instances.

* If the thing you are doing with `SCMHead` instances is creating `Actionable` objects footnote:[It is conceptually easier to think of these as `Item` instances or even `Job` instances, but perhaps you have some use case that we have not anticipated, so we use the most generic term: `Actionable` objects. If your use case is even more generic that you do not even need the `Actionable` contract then this you can ignore `SCMSource.fetchActions(_head_,_listener_)`] then you *shall* call `SCMSource.fetchActions(_head_,_listener_)` whenever either performing a full index or when an event indicates a change for the corresponding `SCMHead`.
+
Any returned `Action` instances *must* be persisted with the `Actionable` object.
+
TIP: In plain english, when you create a job from a `SCMHead` you *shall* call `SCMSource.fetchActions(_head_,_listener_)` and if that method returns any actions you *must* add the actions with the job and save the job.

* If the thing you are doing with `SCMHead` instances results in creating `Actionable` objects associated with specific the `SCMRevision` for each `SCMHead` footnote:[It is conceptually easier to think of these as `Run` instances or even `Build` instances. You, however, may have some completely different use case that requires using the most general base class. If your use case is even more generic that you do not even need the `Actionable` contract then this you can ignore `SCMSource.fetchActions(_head_,_revision_,_listener_)`] then you *shall* call `SCMSource.fetchActions(_head_,_revision_,_listener_)` whenever you are creating your `Actionable` object for a specific `SCMRevision`.
+
Any returned `Action` instances *must* be persisted with the `Actionable` object.
+
TIP: In plain english, when you trigger a build of a job for a `SCMRevision` you *shall* call `SCMSource.fetchActions(_head_,_revision_,_listener_)` and if that method returns any actions you *must* add the actions to the build before the build is saved.

* If you need to partition your `SCMHead` things, you can use `SCMSource.getCategories()` to obtain the categorization of `SCMHead` instances.

* The idiomatic name footnote:[If only all source control systems could agree a consistent set of names of things] for the kind of thing that a `SCMSource` represents is provided by `SCMSource.getPronoun()`.
+
For example, a Git `SCMSource` might return _Repository_, an Accurev `SCMSource` might return _Depot_, a CVS `SCMSource` might return _Module_ while a Subversion `SCMSource` could return _Repository_ or perhaps even something more generic like _Project_ depending on the way in which the Subversion server is being used footnote:[Do you create one `trunk|branches|tags` per repository or do you use a single big repository and create many `_project_/(trunk|branches|tags)` in that single repository?].

[NOTE]
====
There are some rare but legitimate cases where a `SCMSource` needs to be owned by a `Item` that cannot extend `SCMSourceOwner`.
For example, if you were implementing a `JobProperty` (or an `Action`, etc) that resolves information from a `SCMSource` then the owning item could be `FreeStyleProject` but, as that comes from Jenkins core, we cannot add the `SCMSourceOwner` interface.

In such cases you can use the `SCMSourceOwner.proxyFromItem(item,proxyGetter,sourceSupplier,criteriaSupplier)`.

There are two kinds of proxy that can be returned:

. Requesting a proxy with a `null` `Function<Item,SCMSourceOwner>` indicates that this proxy will not receive `SCMEvent` notification.
You may choose to either use the proxy owner as a single-shot owner, or attach it to the `Item` by storing as a `transient` field in some linking object (i.e. `Action`, `JobProperty`, etc) attached to the `Item`.

. Requesting a proxy with a non-`null` `Function<Item,SCMSourceOwner>` indicates that the proxy will be stored as a `transient` field in some linking object attached to the `Item` and that the owned sources are interested in receiving events.
====

=== Using SCMNavigator instances

If you implement `jenkins.scm.api.SCMNavigatorOwner` your implementation *must*:

* Be discoverable through `jenkins.scm.api.SCMNavigatorOwners`.
+
This is the normal expected situation and will be the case if your implementation is part of the standard `Jenkins.getInstance().getAllItems()` tree.
+
[NOTE]
====
The contract for `hudson.model.Item` does not mandate that instances be discoverable through `Jenkins.getInstance().getAllItems()`.

For example, it is conceivable that a plugin might decide to store `hudson.model.User` specific `hudson.model.Item` through a custom `hudson.model.ItemGroup` attached to the owning user.

If your plugin has decided to wander off the well established idiom, you will have to pay the cost of providing an implementation of `SCMNavigatorOwners.Enumerator` that can discover your `jenkins.scm.api.SCMNavigatorOwner` instances in order to ensure that events are delivered correctly.
====

* Call `SCMNavigator.afterSave(_owner_)` on all the  `SCMNavigatorOwner.getSCMNavigators()` instances after every save of the `SCMNavigatorOwner`.

Your implementation of `jenkins.scm.api.SCMSourceOwner` *should*:

* Persist the results of any discovery of any interesting project instances resulting from calls to `SCMNavigator.visitSources(...)` in some form or other.
+
For example the Branch API plugin creates sub-jobs in an organizational folder for each project that it is interested in.
The project name and attributes are persisted with their corresponding sub-jobs..

* Have a `jenkins.scm.api.SCMEventListener` implementation to respond to events.
+
The listener will need to update the required `SCMNavigatorOwner` instances on the basis of the event and should minimize full indexing, e.g. by using the `SCMNavigator.visitSources(_observer_, _event_)` variants.
+
NOTE: `SCMSourceEvent` and `SCMHeadEvent` events can transition a project from non-interesting to interesting, so a `SCMNavigatorOwner` will need to listen out for these events also.
For example, an Organization Folder for Workflow jobs would need to see if any SCMHeadEvent for a
project name that has not been created yet leads to a verification as to whether the named head actually contains a `Jenkinsfile`.
If a `Jenkinsfile` were present then the project would need to be created in order to enable the branch specific grandchild job to be created.

* Persist the results of `SCMNavigator.fetchActions(_owner_, _listener_)` as part of each index and on receipt of any `SCMNavigatorEvent` events of type `UPDATED`.
+
If two `SCMNavigator` instances have the same `SCMNavigator.getId()` then the `SCMNavigatorOwner` can use a shared set of actions for these instances as they are both navigating the same thing (although with different selection criteria)
+
[TIP]
====
It may not always be either possible or preferred to attach the actions directly to the owner.

For example, `hudson.model.AbstractProject` subclasses do not allow modification of the project's actions (because `AbstractProject.getActions()` returns a read-only list and `Actionable.addAction(_action_)` tries to add the action to the list returned by `getActions()`).

An alternative is to persist the actions through some other mechanism (in the case of the `AbstractProject` subclass, we could store them in a `JobProperty`) and then populate at runtime them using a `TransientItemActionFactory`
====

The primary purpose of the `SCMNavigator` API is to allow the enumeration of named projects which each have a corresponding `SCMSource` instances, so presumably you have implemented `SCMSourceOwner` because you want to do something with the `SCMSource` instances.

* Override `SCMSourceObserver.isObserving()` and `SCMSourceObserver.getIncludes()` if you are only interested in a subset so that implementations can minimize the amount of work that they do.

* If your observer is not interested in any specific project, just return `NoOpProjectObserver.instance()` for those instances.

* If you need to partition your `SCMSource` things, you can use `SCMNavigator.getCategories()` to obtain the categorization of `SCMSource` instances.

* The idiomatic name for the kind of thing that a `SCMNavigator` represents is provided by `SCMNavigator.getPronoun()`.
+
For example, a GitHub `SCMNavigator` might return _Organization_, an Accurev `SCMSource` might return _Repository_, a CVS `SCMSource` might return _Server_ while a Subversion `SCMSource` could return _Repository_ or _Server_ depending on the way in which the Subversion server is being used.
